<h1>You Say</h1>
<h2>Lauren Daigle</h2>
<h3> Intro </h3>
<p> I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know
Ooh-oh</p>
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<p>You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
And you say I am held when I am falling short
And when I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours
And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
I believe </p>
<h5> Verse 1</h5>
<p>The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth, in You, I find my identity
Ooh-oh</p>
<repeat> <h4> Chorus</h4></repeat>
<p>You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
And you say I am held when I am falling short
And when I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours
And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
I believe</p>
<h6> Versus 2</h6>
<p>Taking all I have, and now I'm laying it at Your feet
Ooh-oh</p>
<repeat> <h4>Chorus</h4> </repeat>
<p>You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
And you say I am held when I am falling short
And when I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours
And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
I believe </p>

<p>Oh, I believe (I)
Yes, I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
I believe</p>
