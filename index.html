<h1>You Say</h1>
<h2>Lauren Daigle</h2>
<h3> Intro </h3>
<p> I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough<br>
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up<br>
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?<br>
Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know
Ooh-oh</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing<br>
You say I am strong when I think I am weak<br>
And you say I am held when I am falling short<br>
And when I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours<br>
And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)<br>
What You say of me (I)
I believe </p>
<h3> Verse 1</h3>
<p>The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me<br>
In You, I find my worth, in You, I find my identity<br>
Ooh-oh</p>
<h4> Chorus</h4>
<p>You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing<br>
You say I am strong when I think I am weak<br>
And you say I am held when I am falling short<br>
And when I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours<br>
And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)<br>
What You say of me (I)<br>
I believe</p>
<h3> Versus 2</h3>
<p>Taking all I have, and now I'm laying it at Your feet<br>
Ooh-oh</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing<br>
You say I am strong when I think I am weak<br>
And you say I am held when I am falling short<br>
And when I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours<br>
And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)<br>
What You say of me (I)
I believe </p>
<h3>Verse 3</h3>
<p>Oh, I believe (I)<br>
Yes, I believe (I)<br>
What You say of me (I)<br>
I believe</p>
