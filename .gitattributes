<h1> You Say</h1>
<h2> Lauren Daigle </h2>
<h3> Verse 1 </h3>
<p> I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know
Ooh-oh</p>
<h2> Chorus </h2>
<p> You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
And you say I am held when I am falling short
And when I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours
And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
I believe </p>
<h2> Verse 2 <h/2>
<p> The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth, in You, I find my identity
Ooh-oh </p>
<h2> Chorus </h2>
<p> You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
And you say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours
And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
Oh, I believe </p>
<h2> Versus 3 <h/2>
<p> Taking all I have, and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God, You have every victory
Ooh-oh </p>
<h2> Chorus </h2>
<p>You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours
And I believe I, oh, I believe I
What You say of me I
I believe </p>
<h2> versus 4 </h2>
<p> Oh, I believe I
Yes, I believe I
What You say of me I
I believe </p>
